          <label>How would you rate our service?</label>
          <label class="label-wrap"> \\ here we add a class to these labels because we had already said in CSS that the labels would be in bold. We don't want these to be bold because they are a subset of the real label, so they should be in ROM. So we add a new class so that these sub-labels will be in ROM but the first label will still be in bold.
            <input type="radio" name="rating" value="10">
            Awesome \\ it's fairly common not to give radios ids because you want the button in line with the text.
          </label>
             <label class="label-wrap">
            <input type="radio" name="rating" value="5">
            Just OK
          </label>
             <label class="label-wrap">
            <input type="radio" name="rating" value="1">
            Terrible
          </label>
        </div>
                </div>
        <div class="field labels-wrapping">\\ an alternate way to do it would be to use a double class on the div. but that would unbold all of the labels, and we still want the top label to be in bold. Here you don't need to make a class for the sub-labels. if you used an h-tag on the top one to make it bold again, you'd have to go through and change the size/everything to match the rest of the bold labels. So this is not how he would do this. Or you could use an id on the first label, like label-radio, and assign the same bold style as the rest of the labels for just that id. OR you could say this class.class > label normal and class.class label:first-child to set it to bold. He thinks this last one would work well. He thinks this one works best because you could use this double-class on other sections, and not have to class all of the labels individually.
